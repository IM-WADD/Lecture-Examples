            <p>This section (black background) and its child aside (blue background) have padding set to 5% and margin set to 10%. This means 
                the margin and padding of the aside will be smaller than those of the section because they are calculated as a percentage 
                of the section width and height.

            <h1>This Section Uses Viewport Units for Margin and Padding</h1>
            <p>This section (black background) and its child aside (blue background) have padding set to 5vh, 5 vw and margin set to 
                10vh and 10vw. This means the margin and padding of the aside will be the same as those of the section. The margin and padding in 
                this section will be bigger than the margin and padding in the section above.
