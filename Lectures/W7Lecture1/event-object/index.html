        <p>Open the console then click anywhere on the page to see a PointerEvent. Click the triangle icon next 
            to a PointerEvent in the console and find its prototype (usually after all properties and methods). 
            Then, find the prototype of that prototype. Keep looking for the next link in the prototype chain 
            until you get to Object.
