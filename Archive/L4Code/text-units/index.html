            <h1>This Section Uses Pixels For Everything</h1>
            <p>The default font size for paragraphs is usually 16px. The CSS for this section sets the paragraph font size to 16px and the heading 
                font size to 64px, 4 times the paragraph size.
            </p>
            <p>
                Browsers allow users to change the default font size of webpages. This is important for 
                accessibility purposes. However, this functionality only works if CSS controlling font 
                sizes is following the best practice of using relative units.
            </p>
            <p>In Chrome, go to Preferences &gt; Appearance and change the font size to "very large" then "very small". Notice how the text 
                on this page does or doesn't change in line with the preference change. When the preference is "medium" (browser default), the headings 
                and paragraphs in each section should be the same size.
            </p>

        <section id="relative-size">
            <h1>This Section Uses Relative Units</h1>
            <p>The CSS for the previous section uses fixed pixel units for the font sizes. This section uses relative 
                units. The paragraph setting is 1em, which equates to the browser setting for paragraphs times 1. The 
                heading setting is 4em, which equates to the browser setting for paragraphs times 4.
            </p>
            <p>The following list has a font size of 2em, so its contents should be twice as big as the text above (except where further styling is applied!)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This list item doesn't have its own font size rule.</li>
                <li id="em-item">This list item has a font size of 1em, so it will be the same as the parent (the list).</li>
                <li id="rem-item">This list item has a font size of 1rem, so it will be the same as the overall html font size.</li>
